# About Me

üëã Hi, I'm Oliwer! I'm a fullstack software engineer at Contractbook, working on extending and maintaining both the frontend and backend parts of the app.

## Bio üß¨

I've been making websites for my hobby projects since my teenage years, and I decided to pursue this passion in my professional career.

First, I pursued a more academic path and graduated from Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan with a master's degree in computer science. My studies and internships gave me a taste of various technical directions, including low-level programming in C/C++, game development in C#/Unity/XNA, and even Natural Language Processing. After experimenting with all of these, I chose to focus on the web platform.

My first significant work experience was at Wunderman Thompson Technology (formerly Cognifide, now part of VML), where I built web applications on top of Adobe Experience Manager for corporate clients such as Ford, HSBC, Unilever, and Colgate-Palmolive. During this time, I specialized in frontend development, solidifying my foundation in JS/CSS/HTML, learning frameworks from AngularJS to React, and focusing on web accessibility.

Later, I decided to test myself in a startup environment and joined Contractbook. This is where I became a more well-rounded developer and began working on the backend as well, which led me to learn Elixir.
